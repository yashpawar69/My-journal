# **App Name**: My Journal

## Core Features:

- Post Creation: Allow users to create blog posts using a text editor interface.
- Post Display: Display all blog posts on the main page.
- Post Editing: Enable users to update existing blog posts.
- Post Deletion: Allow users to delete blog posts.
- AI Tag Suggestion: Use an AI tool to suggest relevant tags based on the content of the blog post. The tag suggestions should update live, with only minimal delay after the user pauses their typing.

- Clean and structured layout with a focus on readability. Use white space to separate content blocks.
- Simple, modern icons for actions like edit, delete, and add. Use icons consistently throughout the application.
- Subtle transitions when navigating between posts and when saving changes to give the user reassurance that actions were registered.
